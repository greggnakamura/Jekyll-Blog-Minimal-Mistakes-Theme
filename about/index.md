Currently, I work remotely for [Wakefly, Inc.](http://www.wakefly.com/), a Boston, MA based online marketing firm. I am an Full Stack, Front End focused, Developer.

I use my [Twitter Favorites](https://twitter.com/greggnakamura/favorites) quite a bit to flag mostly development related items as a personal resource. I'm also a regular reader of [Nettuts](https://code.tutsplus.com/), [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/), and [SitePoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/).

In my spare time I participate in coding challenges ([CodeEval](https://www.codeeval.com/) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)), [take training courses](http://www.pluralsight.com/), and attend developer related [MeetUps](http://www.meetup.com/find/events/?allMeetups=false&keywords=web+development&radius=50&userFreeform=Los+Angeles%2C+CA&mcId=z90001&mcName=Los+Angeles%2C+CA&eventFilter=mysugg).

### When I'm not coding...
When I'm not Sublime Texting things, you can find me at the local race track or at an F1 MeetUp. My second love is auto racing. This bug hit me back in '93 when I attended my first event, the Long Beach Grand Prix and I've been hooked ever since. Religiously, I follow:

* [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/)
* Sports Car Racing
    * [WEC](http://www.fiawec.com/)
    * [TUDOR United SportsCar](http://www.imsa.com/series/united-sportscar)
    * [Continental Tire](http://www.imsa.com/series/sportscar-challenge)
    * [Pirelli World Challenge](http://www.world-challenge.com/)
* [IndyCar](http://www.indycar.com/)
