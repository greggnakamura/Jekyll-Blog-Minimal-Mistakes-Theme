I've been a full time remote employee since mid 2010 and, truth be told, I love it, but, it's been a bit of a roller coaster along the way.

The initial thrill of it ended pretty early for me as I found the overall challenges tougher than I would have ever imagined. For one, the comfort of being able to walk over to another Developer to discuss problem was gone. I also couldn't visually see who was busy and who was not. Most importantly, I was now missing out on the spontaneous discussions of code, work, and office live in general.

As for my office, when your home becomes 'it', perspectives change to say the least. You begin to think about, at least for me I did, what I can and can't do in my own house.

- Don't leave your machine for more than 2 minutes because someone might need you
- Check mail regularly...even though I have notifications enabled
- Check chat regularly...even though I have notifications enabled
- Radio OFF!
- TV OFF!!
- ELIMINATE DISTRACTIONS!!!

I realize the items above are my own unique use case, but I think you get the gist. Working remotely changes your comfort zone, and in a lot of ways, makes your job even harder.

Working ~3,000 miles from my main office (Massachusetts) makes it difficult to 'pop-in' from time to time, so I've made some adjustments for work and my clients.

- I'm available during East Coast hours
- I'm 'online' via Skype and participate is chats as best as I can
- Use video to humanize myself
- Actively reach out to my PMs on a regular basis
- Attend all applicable office and client meetings

After some trial and error, this approach seems to be the best way to give myself an 'office' presence. Those in-office, and my client's, don't have to work around my schedule and I can be counted basically at all times when needed.

One other rather large issue was the active communication among my Developer peers. From afar, I can't just swing my chair around and participate anymore. This is the biggest part of office life that I miss. Developers learn a lot from other Developers and my community was now 3,000 miles away.

I do regularly contact and meet with my Developer colleagues, but it's just not the same. So, over the years, I've looked to other resources to bridge this gap.

- **Twitter**: I pretty much follow anyone and anything that plays a part in influencing me as a Developer and use my *Favorites* as a 'bookmark' for resources. You'd be surprised at how much spontaneous enlightenment comes from it
- **MeetUps**: Gives me a chance to physically talk to other Developers and get a much different perpective on what we do in general. I find it quite valuable.
- **Nettuts**: There are many sites out there to keep you up to date on current technologies, but over the years, I've used this repeatedly.
- **Former Colleagues**: An invaluable network of knowledge. Keep them close. Their experiences, past and present, are gold.
